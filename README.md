## Brief

A newly launched accommodation booking site called Holidaze has approached you to develop a brand new front-end for their application. While they have a list of required features, the design and user experience has not been specified. Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front-end accommodation booking application.
There are two aspects to this brief: the customer-facing side of the website where users can book holidays at a venue, and an admin-facing side of the website where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues.
